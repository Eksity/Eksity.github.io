            <p class="aboutme">Hi! my name's Jesse, but across the internet you can find me as <strong>Eksity</strong>.<br>
            This site is intended to be a homepage of sorts, both to categorize and show off my various engineering and coding projects I'm hoping to work on.
            <br>This is intended to be a living and perpetually unfinished (though complete) site, and it will update with new styles and features
            as both my taste in design and my coding skills develop. For instance at the time of writing I have no experience with JavaScript, although that will soon change.</p>

            <p> this is a footer, I'm not entirely sure what to put here yet.</p>
